# 👋 Hi, I'm Will McDonald

**Data Analyst | Systems Thinker | SQL Craftsman | BI Storyteller**

I build clarity from complexity.  
With over five years of experience transforming raw data into actionable intelligence, I specialize in **SQL development, Power BI**, and **process documentation** that align analytics with operational strategy.

My focus isn’t just on dashboards or reports — it’s on creating **living blueprints** of how data, systems, and people connect.

## 🧩 What I Do Best

- **SQL Engineering & Optimization**  
  Designing efficient queries, automating ETL pipelines, and translating business questions into logical data models.

- **Data Storytelling in Power BI**  
  Building dashboards that don’t just visualize metrics — they *reveal patterns* and drive better decisions.

- **Systems Documentation & Governance**  
  Creating structured SOPs, metadata maps, and process documentation that unify data governance with accessibility.

- **Cross-Team Collaboration**  
  Bridging technical and non-technical teams through clear, written communication — especially when stakes are high or details are complex.

## Philosophy

> “Good analysis isn’t about answers — it’s about structure and commitment to consistency.”

I approach analytics as both **craft and architecture**: every query, join, and dashboard should clarify how the system itself *thinks*.  
I believe precision, empathy, and context are as important as raw technical skill.

## Current Focus

I'm expanding into **game and creative tech analytics**, where data meets design.  
I’m especially interested in how analytics helps to craft **stories, better player experience**, and ethical decision-making in interactive media.

## Selected Projects

- **50 years of Lego (Power BI)** – Automated reconciliation of product information for Lego to provide insights by product and category
- **Spotify (Power BI)** – Tracked my own ten years of Spotify listening to analyze how my tastes have changed over time.
- **Operational Metrics Dashboard** – Unified ticketing, SLAs, and productivity metrics from multiple data sources into one cohesive BI model.

*(Additional repositories and case studies coming soon.)*

## About Me

I’m a lifelong learner with a background in business analytics and a love for **clarity, systems, and storytelling**.  
Neurodivergent, detail-oriented, and relentless about getting things right but, grounded in keeping it simple.

Outside of data, you’ll find me studying **game design systems**, building **process maps**, or walking my pit bull, Ronin.
